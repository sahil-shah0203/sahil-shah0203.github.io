        <br>
        Restoration and upgrade of a 1988 Pontiac Firebird Formula. Some basic information: bought it for about $3k and sold
         it for about $9k. Every single purchase was documented in a bill of materials. A build plan was written out, and notes
          were taken at each checkpoint/obstacle in the build plan. The car was restored up to street safety standards but the 
          'hot rod red' paint job and custom cognac leather interior were just for fun. I believe this was a good use of my mechanical
           engineering skills and a good way to learn about the car industry. Many parts of the engine needed to be replaced in 
           addition to the cosmetics and it worked in great condition when sold. Overall, I learned a lot about cars, made 
           tons of connections around Austin in the car community, and would love to take on a project like this again. I 
           hope to buy back a 1988 Firebird one day when I have time to consistently maintain it. One thing 
           I hope this helps me in the future is enhancing my skills in the hardware field. I'd love 
           to further study machines and potentially get into AI for automated vehicles and more.
