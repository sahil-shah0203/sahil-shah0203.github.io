        <h1>Delivery Drone</h1>
        <br>
        Created a quad-copter drone that would deliver emergency medical supplies to students on campus at the click of a button.
        Designed the body with CAD and 3D printed it. Followed a budget to purchase carbon fiber wings, motors and an Arduino brain. 
        Soldered the electrical components together and then programmed an AI flight control algorithm for a drone to travel the 
        safest and quickest path to and from destination.

        This project was done for an on-campus organization called Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Austin (UAVA) for which I was both a participating 
        engineer and lead project manager.
