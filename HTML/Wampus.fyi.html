        In a high-pressure environment at HackTX, a hackathon hosted at UT Austin, our team of four rose to the challenge. With just 24 hours on the clock, we were tasked with creating a project that showcased our skills while making a real impact. The result of our dedication and hard work was a web application designed to address a pressing issue - the lack of accessible information on off-campus housing at UT Austin.
<br><br>
Our innovative solution offered crowd-sourced and verified pricing data for housing complexes that typically remained unrecorded by government real estate agencies. This technology was not only incredibly scalable but also user-friendly, and it secured 1st place among 103 competing teams who worked tirelessly throughout the weekend. Moreover, our project, Wampus.fyi, received recognition in the "Best Use of Streamlit" category, thanks to the robust frontend powered by Streamlit technology.
