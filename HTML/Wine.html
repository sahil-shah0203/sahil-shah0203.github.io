          Starting with a free dataset of of Kaggle, I processed the data into a readable format 
          for machine learning models (turned words to numbers like male=1 and women=0). 
          This data was based on 11 factors such as sulphates and pH, and a final column with the correct wine quality.
          Importing the .csv file into Pandas, I split it into a test-train split of 30%-70% and tested out many 
          different models I thought would work. After a couple tries, since it was all categorical variables, I thought a classifier such as the Random Forrest 
          might work best. Sure enough, the model returned the highest accuracy I had recieved: 61%.
