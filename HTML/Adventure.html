        Over this past summer, I enjoyed traveling while working virtually as a Software Engineering Intern. During my 11 week internship, 
        I was fortunate enough to get to explore some incredible cities. Here are my short descriptions of trips. <br><br>
        <ul>
          <h3><li>Atlanta, GA</li></h3>
          Home Depot flew out all of the 300+ interns to Atlanta for the first week of the 11-week program. I visited the College Football Hall 
          of Fame, the Atlanta Aquarium, the Battery and some amazing restaurants. I made some great friends and learned a lot about the job I would spend 
          the next 3 months doing. 
          <br>
          <h3><li>San Diego, CA</li></h3>
          I stayed with my friend at UCSD in La Jolla at a dorm in the Sixth College for about 6 days. The suite absolutely blew my mind at the sheer ability 
          to cram such a large amount of people into such a small space. The 2-story dorm suite housed 30 people, with 2-3 students per room. 
          It was quite easy to make lots of friends when you're living so closely with them. Although, the closets were the size of a Costco 
          storage bin, the suite was very intimate and it was very fun to live around people. I got to hang out at the beach whenever I wanted, 
          hiking the coastal trails and watching brilliant orange sunsets over the ocean. The Thai food and ramen closeby was some of 
          the best I've ever tasted. Downtown San Diego felt energetic and family-friendly when I visited on the weekend. And I attended Sun God, 
          UCSD's big music festival held on campus, which was an awesome experience.
